This directory contains start and stop scripts for the cmsd, olbd (deprecated)
and xrootd, as well as a monitoring script for the cmsd when you wish to use
load based balancing. Please note that the cmsd and olbd provide the same
services but you must use one or the other everywhere. You may not mix them. The
cmsd is the prefered daemon (the olbd is provided for backward compatability).

The documentation for each script is contained within the script itself. Please
read the header comments in each script before using the script!

The StartCMS script starts the cmsd and must have a StartCMS.cf file installed
in the same directory as the start script. This distribution includes a
StartCMS.cf.example file to guide you through setting the various variables
to the appropriate values. Please create your own StartCMS.cf file from this
example file.

The StartXRD script starts the xrootd and must have a StartXRD.cf file installed
in the same directory as the start script. This distribution includes a
StartXRD.cf.example file to guide you through setting the various variables
to the appropriate values. Please create your own StartXRD.cf file from this
example file.

You need not use the provided start/stop scripts. However, they are provided
here as a helpful aid in managing the servers.

Don't forget to modify your init scripts to start the servers at boot time!
