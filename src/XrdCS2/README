This directory contains the source to build the xrootd/olbd interface to CERN's
CASTOR2 system. It is only supported for linux platforms as this is the only
platform support by the Castor service. Follow the steps:

0) cd to the xrootd directory (the enclosing directory).
1) Run bootstrap.sh (autotools) or configure.classic.
2) Compile, as needed the xroot/olb source tree.
3) cd into this directory.
4) Issue gmake to compile the contents therin.

The following will be built:

a) In bin: XrdCS2d      - the daemon run by xrootd on each disk server node.
                          Normally, istalled in "/xroot/bin".

b) in lib: libXrdCS2.so - the XMI library used by the olbd on the Castor server.
                          Normally, istalled in "/xroot/lib".

This directory also contains XrdCS2e which is a shell script that also needs
to be installed on each disk server (normally, in "/xroot/bin").

This directory also has sample configuration files:

xrd.cf.standalone - to run the system without clustering support
xrd.cf.clustered  - to run the system with    clustering support

More information can be found in the reference guide:
