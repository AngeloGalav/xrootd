Xrdcp is a cp-like tool to copy files:
- FROM an xrootd system TO a local file system
- FROM ax xrootd system TO an xrootd system (even the same)
- FROM a local file system TO an xrootd system



Usage:                                                               
      xrdcp [-d<debuglevel>] <source> <dest>
  where:                                    
      <source> can be:
               - the path/name of a local file file or directory
               - the xrootd URL of a file   

      <dest> can be:
             - the path/name of the local dest file or directory
             - the xrootd URL of a file or directory           
                                                                 

An xrootd URL is an URL in the form handled by XrdClient, i.e.:
root://host1[:port1][,host2[:port2]]..[,hostN[:portN]]//filepath

The debug levels are as follows:
 0 - the default. Print nothing but the errors.
 1 - Prints relevant info about the behavior and the situations encountered
 2 - Prints request and response for every interaction with the server
 3 - Dump everything
