You will find the Clust Name Space daemon that must run on each data server in
the bin subdirectory of this directory. It is called XrdCnsd. Some architectures
have been pre-compiled. If you do not find the one you need or you wish to
recompile XrdCnsd, read the README.BUILD file to see how its done. Otherwise,
install the XrdCnsd daemon on each data server and follow the steps below for
configuring each server to use XrdCnsd facilities.

Requirement #1: Each data server's config file must have the following line 
                added to it:

ofs.notify create mkdir mv rm rmdir |<path>/XrdCnsd [options] <route>

Where:
<route> - is the location of the xroot server that maintains the name space.
          This is specified as the URL prefix to any LFN encountered by the
          data server. For instance: "xroot://io:1094/". You may also specify
          a path prefix to the LFN by adding a path to the URL. So, say the
          name space server export /cns then the URL should be specified as
          "xroot://io:1094//cns".

<options>

-a <apath>   The adminstrative path where various files are kept. The default
             comes from whatever the xroot server is using and if that
             cannot be determined it defaults to /tmp. Typically, you need not
             specify it.

-d           debugging

-l <logfile> Where you want the error message logfile to go. This is normally 
             specified.

-q <qlim>    The max number of events that should be logged before events are
             dropped. The log is used to recover from crashes as well as
             name space server outages. The default is 1024. If you think that
             the name server may suffer long outages then you should increase
             the number. Note that each record is 2K long.

Requirement #2: You must run a standard xroot server that will be used by
                XrdCnsd to maintain a composite image of the cluster's name
                space. This server need not be clustered (we can't imagine why
                you would want to). You may find it convenient to run it on a
                redirector at some other port number. You must setup a 
                directory where all of the LFN's will be kept as a true
                hierarchical name space. Typically, choose some root directory.
                The server either must export this root (and you specify it
                in the ofs.notify directive) or it exports some portion of the
                LFN prefix and you use the all.localroot directive to attach
                the root directory to each LFN.

Optional #3:    You can create a seamless environment by adding the following
                directive to each redirector's configuration file:

xrootd.redirect <host>[:<port>] dirlist

                where <host>:<port> is the host (and port) of the cluster name
                space xrootd server. This directive will automatically
                redirect clients to this server should they try to list the
                contents of a directory. If you do not add this directive,
                then the redirector itself will try to list the directory.
                This wll fail unless the redirector's localroot is identical
                to the localroot (i.e., path prefix) used by the name space
                xrootd server.
