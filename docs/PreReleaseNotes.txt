Prerelease Notes
================

+ **New Features**
   * Report the timezone when connecting to a [meta]manager.
   * Allow configuration of staging, migration, and purging events.
   * Allow transfer script to inject information into the monitoring stream.
   * Report number of attempted login, authentication failures, successful
     authenticated and unauthenticated logins in the summary statistics.
   * Indicate whether a disconnect was forced and whether it was a parallel
     path (as opposed to a control path) in the monitoring record.

+ **Major bug fixes**
   * Don't force libXrdPss.so to be loaded for proxy managers.
   * Avoid SEGV in ClientSid class by making it fully thread-safe. This
     largely affects xrdcp and some clients on slow links.

+ **Minor bug fixes**
   * Add 'k' to the option list. It was wrongly deleted in the last option
     refalgamization.
   * Make sure to cut close records for open files during a forced disconnect
     when monitoring file information.
   * Do not create meta-files or update extended attributes when placing a
     file into read-only space.

+ **Miscellaneous**
