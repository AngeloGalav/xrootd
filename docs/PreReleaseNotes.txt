+ **New Features**
   * Allow a plugin (notably the proxy plugin) to disable async I/O.
   * Implement a general memory caching object. Currently, this will be used
     by the Posix object.
   * Allow optional memory caching when using the Posix library. This is
     primarily used by the proxy object to reduce trips to a data server when
     small blocks are accessed via the proxy server. This requires
     configuration using the new 'pss.memcache' directive.
+ **Major bug fixes**
   * Properly parse oss.asize. This because a major problem when xrdcp started
     adding this to the url which causes the copy to fail.
   * Spin connection portion of proxy initialization to a background thread.
     This prevents init.d hangs when a redirector is not available.
   * Fix incorrect lock handling for multiple waiters.
+ **Minor bug fixes**
   * Report correct port when locate is directly issued to a data server
     (before it was being reported as 0).
   * Make the default file system a pointer to a dynamic instance of XrdOfs
     instead of a global static (i.e. the Andreas Peters patch). This makes
     writing an ofs plugin easier.

   * XrootdFS: all paramenters can be passed via command line, add -h.

+ **Major bug fixes**
   * Async write errors are now being properly caught and reacted to.
     XrdClient::Close will now fail if it cannot recover from async
     write errors.

     the xrootd-client RPM
   * RPM: FFS moved from libs to client
