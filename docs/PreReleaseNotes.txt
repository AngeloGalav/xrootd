Prerelease Notes
================

+ **New Features**
   * Allow suspending and enabling remote debugging without a restart.
   * Implement black/whitelist with optional redirection.
   * Provide mechanism to pass command line arguments to plugins.

+ **Major bug fixes**
   * Correct lock loophole introduced by commit d9014d7d that may
     cause SEGV.
   * Do not hold the global lock when closing a file. For proxies this
     stalls all open/close operations should the remote file server be
     very slow in closing the file. This solves many timeout issues.
   * Avoid SEGV when deleting a partially empty table.

+ **Minor bug fixes**
   * Avoid memory leak when deleting a detached channel.

+ **Miscellaneous**
   * Avoid serializing stat() via the proxy to improve performance.
   * Provide consistency for RLIM_INFINITY in getrlimit(RLIMIT_NOFILE).
   * Detect misconfigured or unavailable ipV6 stacks and revert to ipV4.
   * Recreate the logfile fifo if the existing one cannot be used.
