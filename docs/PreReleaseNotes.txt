XRootD
======

Prerelease Notes
================

+ **New Features**

+ **Major bug fixes**
  * [Server/Proxy] Delay deleting a file object if the close was not successful.
    This avoids deleting objects that may have pending activity resulting in an
    eventual SEGV. This is a bypass fix to another problem.

+ **Minor bug fixes**

+ **Miscellaneous**
   * [Client] Make sure kXR_mkpath is set for classic copy jobs when
     the destination is xrootd (backward compatability fix).
