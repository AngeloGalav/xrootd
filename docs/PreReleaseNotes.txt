Prerelease Notes
================

+ **New Features**
   * Allow suspending and enabling remote debugging without a restart.
   * Implement black/whitelist with optional redirection.
   * Provide mechanism to pass command line arguments to plugins.

+ **Major bug fixes**
   * Reorder ofs initialization in 4.1 to avoid disabling frm
     notifications; which makes frm staging useless.
   * Fixes #218 - properly reset suspend state for reconecting cmsd's.
   * Avoid SEGV when environment pointer is nil.
   * Add all host IP's to the allow list.
   * Correct lock loophole introduced by commit d9014d7d that may
     cause SEGV.
   * Do not hold the global lock when closing a file. For proxies this
     stalls all open/close operations should the remote file server be
     very slow in closing the file. This solves many timeout issues.
   * Avoid SEGV when deleting a partially empty table.

+ **Minor bug fixes**
   * Avoid disabling async I/O when using an oss plugin that does not
     implement file compression.
   * Do not use the same flag bit for -I and --tpc as this makes -I
     unuseable (fixes #213).
   * Avoid memory leak when deleting a detached channel.

+ **Miscellaneous**
   * Pass along environment to plugins that need it.
   * Disable POSC processing when the proxy plugin is loaded.
   * Avoid serializing stat() via the proxy to improve performance.
   * Provide consistency for RLIM_INFINITY in getrlimit(RLIMIT_NOFILE).
   * Detect misconfigured or unavailable ipV6 stacks and revert to ipV4.
   * Recreate the logfile fifo if the existing one cannot be used.
