Prerelease Notes
================
+ **New Features**
   * Provide a libevent type replacement package.
   * Allow tracker files (e.g. ".fail") to be placed in a shadow directory.
     This is controlled by the new fdir option on the oss.xfr directive.
   * Allow meta-files (i.e. .fail file) to be relocated to a shadow directory
     using the oss.xfr directive. This avoids polluting the exported name
     space when an frm transfer operation fails.
   * Create a general place for platform dependent utility methods.
   * Add third party copy statistics to the summary record.

+ **Major bug fixes**
   * Add missing include for compiling with gcc-4.7 (from Sebastien Binet).
     This patch is required for successful compilation.
   * Fix <exp> tag in ofs statistics. It is improperly terminated and may
     cause certain xml parsers to fail; rendering monitoring useless.
   * Prevent SEGV when xrd.monitor rbuff value not specified.
   * Correct test whether or not to initialize redirect monitoring. The old
     code never initialized it this disabling redirect monitoring. 
   * Prevent double-free abort when more than 16 files have been opened by a
     client and the client terminates the session without closing the 17th one.
   * Undo the side-effect of commit ff8bdbd6 that prevented the frm from
     sending stage notifications to xrootd; causing opens and xrdstagetool
     to hang with dynamic staging enabled.
   * Make sure the id buffer is large enough to hold all id combinations.
   * Avoid deadlock when closing a Posix File with an active preread.
   * For concurrent queries for the same file allow servers to respond to the
     query and only redirect clients to a stageable server if the file is not found. 

+ **Minor bug fixes**
   * Make sure opendir() returns a null pointer when the directory doesn't
     exist.
   * Make sure that XrootdFS returns ENOENT when opendir() returns a null.
   * Make sure to use correct time to set mtime/atime after a physical reloc.
   * Correct monitor initialization test to start monitor under all configs.
   * Prevent hangs when doing exterme copy from server to server.
   * Correct log processing for sites that use the root directory as the
     stomping ground for newly created files.
   * Fix the -force option to really work for the mark subcommand.
   * Pass through error code returned by the N2N plug-in. This only affects
     the proxy server and caused feature interference.
   * Automatically exclude originating server/cluster on an enoent static
     redirect.
   * Correct typos XRDPSOIX envars should really be named XRDPOSIX.

+ **Miscellaneous**
   * Add port to prepare request struct as documented in 2.9.9.
   * Add pathid to readv request struct as documented in 2.9.9.
